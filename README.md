Sorting Algorithms sorting means arranging the set of data in ascending or descending order.

Types of Sorting Algorithm can be classified as space used and stability Space Used: In Space and Out Space Stability: Stable and Unstable

InSpace Algorithm: Which does not required any extra space for sorting. Example Bubble Sort OutSpace Algorithm: Alorithm required extra space for sorting. Example Merge Sort

Stable Sort: in sorting algorithm after sort it does not the change the sequence of the content and looks similar then this sort is called stable sort. [70,10,80,40,20,40,60,50,90] [10,20,40,40,50,60,60,80,90] here 40 comes 2 times and it does not change 40 order frist 40 will cum first second 40 will cum second Example : Inserstion sort

Unstable sort: in sorting if content changes it sequence then it is called unstable sort Example: Quick Sort

Bubble Sort : Bubble sort is also referred to sinking sort We repeatedly compare each pair of adjacent item and swap if they are in wrong order.
