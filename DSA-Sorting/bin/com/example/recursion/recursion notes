Recursion: 
        Function calling itself is called recursion.

Points to keep in mind during recursion:
    1, Base condition.
    2, All ways call the function with smaller function
    
 Recursion : Persist of the state 
             Reading of the code.
             
In traditional recursion, the typical model is that you perform your recursive calls first, 
and then you take the return value of the recursive call and calculate the result.
 In this manner, you don't get the result of your calculation until 
 you have returned from every recursive call.

In tail recursion, you perform your calculations first, 
and then you execute the recursive call, passing the results 
of your current step to the next recursive step. 
This results in the last statement being in the form of (return (recursive-function params)). 
Basically, the return value of any given recursive 
step is the same as the return value of the next recursive call.


Time and Space Complexity:
           time complexity of recursive function : O(n)
           Space Complexity of recursive function: O(n)
